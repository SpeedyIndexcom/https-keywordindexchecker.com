This tool helps SEO specialists, marketers, and website owners understand how Google perceives specific keywords by generating direct links to Google searches using advanced operators. It simplifies the process of checking:

*   Whether a keyword appears as an **exact match** (`"keyword"`).
*   Whether a keyword is present in page **titles** (`intitle:"keyword"`).
*   Whether a keyword is part of page **URLs** (`inurl:"keyword"`).
*   Whether **Web Stories** related to the keyword are indexed.
